# Roadmap

## Add containers cleanup

Depending on container status (running, exited, stopped, created), support container removal after a customizable delay

## Volume cleanup

Clean up volumes docker created automatically that remains after container removal

## Automatic image pull

When an image is pulled, add a feature to update it to its latest version on a regular delay
